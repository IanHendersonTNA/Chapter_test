            <h1>Testing Automated Transcription Services</h1>
            
           
        
        <h2>Automated Transcription Services</h2>
        
                <p class="explain">Page content best viewed at a browser width of 980px or higher</p>
                 
           
         <p>Automated Transcription Services are online systems that offer the capability to process either a live stream audio source such as from a microphone, or from recorded audio from within a digital file, to then output text (in some format) from speech by using speech-recognition in combination with other technologies - possibly involving aspects of 'Machine Learning' and Artificial Intelligence'.</p>    
         
         <h4>Features</h4>
                  
         <p>Some common features that may be offered by automated services are:</p>
         
         <ul>
             <li>automatic speech recognition - which may be enabled by a Deep Neural Network</li>
             <li>multiple vocabularies - data sets to enable recognition and processing of different languages, and potentially dialects</li>
             <li>Automatic punctuation - the automatic addition of punctuation to text output</li>
             <li>Speaker recognition</li>
             <li>Multi-channel recognition - to handle the scenario where individual speakers are recorded on different channels</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>In order to achieve optimal results from services the audio source should carry clearly recorded voices <span class="highlight"><strong>*</strong>without strong accents</span>, and with little to no background noise. Where the audio source is unclear, there are high levels of noise, or speakers do hold strong accents then automated transcription services may struggle, in which case a manual transcription service would be the correct alternative.</p>
         <p><span class="highlight"><strong>*Re: accents:</strong></span> some services such as Amazon transcribe do make provision for English spoken with regional accents: e.g. Australian English (en-AU, Indian English (en-IN), Scottish English (en-AB), Welsh English (en-WL) <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/what-is-transcribe.html" target="_blank">What is Amazon Transcribe?</a></p>
         
      <p><strong><em>To note: </em></strong> <br>Automated services should be considered a means by which an approximate text transcription can be  quickly generated. No matter the supposed accuracy rating they should not be expected to produce wholly complete or accurate results. It is strongly recommended that all text outputs are automatically or manually checked ad validated, especially where a high level of accuracy is important.</p>
        
        <h3>Testing Plan</h3>
        
        <p>Some limited testing was performed in order to broadly evaluate the performance of certain text to speech services in terms of accuracy of output, and feature set of particular service or plan. At the time of review, of those services evaluated within this research period, any free plan or trial options tended to be quite limited: in the extent of testing-time allowed, features included, and/ or in the option to upload files. Where file upload was possible then there was a set limit as to the number and duration of files to be processed.</p>
        <p>For those services that did not support upload of video files  in their free or trial plans but did allow audio-only upload, then audio format files were used, - this was satisfactory as tests were fundamentally focused on the processing of speech from audio.</p>
        <p>Files were uploaded, features of the service/ plan noted and the text output - online preview and editable version of text if any, and text file format export were checked. The text from the export was then checked against a manual transcript that had been produced earlier. The percentage of error in the text export was then worked out.</p>
        

        
        
        <h4>Test 1: Librivox public domain audio file</h4>
        <p><a href="https://librivox.org/">Librivox</a> audio-book readings were one (public domain) source of isolated, single voice recordings for initial testing. They are recorded largely by amateur readers using domestic rather than professional equipment or studio conditions, which provide a more challenging test of speech processing performance.</p>
        
        <p>Services tested with these files were <a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter.ai</a> and <a href="https://vocalmatic.com/">Vocalmatic.com</a></p>

        <ol>
          <li>make note of any paragraph variations that might skew comparison results (either visually or when using text comparison apps)</li>
               <li>check if punctuation in the source throws off comparison checks</li> 
           <li>get the number of errors: 
         <ul>
           <li>count number of errors from output text (with any timecode or other ‘non-written text’ removed), as compared with the online text version (with quotation marks removed as these are not generally created in processed text).</li>
            <li>divide number of errors by total of words</li>
             <li>multiply the figure by 100, and then subtract this figure from 100 to give the error percentage</li>    
          </ul>
          </ol>
           
          <br>
          
          
        <h4>Comparison of Results: Otter.ai vs. Vocalmatic</h4>   
        <p>The two 'toggle-links' below hide or unhide the individual transcription outputs from two services: Otter.ai and Vocalmatic.com, where the same text (Saki's short story 'Louise') had been submitted in audio file format (mp3). In both cases a copy of the complete and correct text has been included at the head of the section  for comparison with the transcription service's text output. Uncommon personal names such as 'Beanford', 'Thropplestance' and 'Clovis Sangrail' were excluded from error ratings</p>  
                
        <p>It can be seen that the Otter.ai return was generally more able to provide a more complete return (the Vocalmatic output contains several instances of missing text) and more accurate results, and it is interesting to note the difference between the two services as to how well they handled particular words and phrases. It may be that, where an initial word is misidentified then further errors within the phrase or otherwise in close proximity may produce other errors as attempts are made to identify other words in context with the original error.</p>

<h4>'LOUISE' (correct and complete text)</h4>

<p>“The tea will be quite cold, you'd better ring for some more," said the Dowager Lady Beanford. </p>

<p>Susan Lady Beanford was a vigorous old woman who had coquetted with imaginary ill-health for the greater part of a lifetime; Clovis Sangrail irreverently declared that she had caught a chill at the Coronation of Queen Victoria and had never let it go again. Her sister, Jane Thropplestance, who was some years her junior, was chiefly remarkable for being the most absent-minded woman in Middlesex. </p>

<p>"I've really been unusually clever this afternoon," she remarked gaily, as she rang for the tea. "I've called on all the people I meant to call on, and I've done all the shopping that I set out to do. I even remembered to try and match that silk for you at Harrod's, but I'd forgotten to bring the pattern with me, so it was no use. I really think that was the only important thing I forgot during the whole afternoon. Quite wonderful for me, isn't it?" </p>

<p>"What have you done with Louise?" asked her sister. "Didn't you take her out with you? You said you were going to." </p>

<p>"Good gracious," exclaimed Jane, "what have I done with Louise? I must have left her somewhere." </p>

<p>"But where?" </p>

<p>"That's just it. Where have I left her? I can't remember if the Carrywoods were at home or if I just left cards. If they were at home I may have left Louise there to play bridge. I'll go and telephone to Lord Carrywood and find out." </p>

<p>"Is that you, Lord Carrywood?" she queried over the telephone; "it's me, Jane Thropplestance. I want to know, have you seen Louise?" </p>

<p>"'Louise,'" came the answer, "it's been my fate to see it three times. At first, I must admit, I wasn't impressed by it, but the music grows on one after a bit. Still, I don't think I want to see it again just at present. Were you going to offer me a seat in your box?" </p>

<p>"Not the opera 'Louise' -my niece, Louise Thropplestance. I thought I might have left her at your house." </p>

<p>“You left cards on us this afternoon, I understand, but I don't think you left a niece. The footman would have been sure to have mentioned it if you had. Is it going to be a fashion to leave nieces on people as well as cards? I hope not; some of these houses in Berkeley-square have practically no accommodation for that sort of thing." </p>

<p>"She's not at the Carrywoods'," announced Jane, returning to her tea; "now I come to think of it, perhaps I left her at the silk counter at Selfridge's. I may have told her to wait there a moment while I went to look at the silks in a better light, and I may easily have forgotten about her when I found I hadn't your pattern with me. In that case she's still sitting there. She wouldn't move unless she was told to; Louise has no initiative." </p>

<p>"You said you tried to match the silk at Harrod's," interjected the dowager. </p>

<p>"Did I? Perhaps it was Harrod's. I really don't remember. It was one of those places where every one is so kind and sympathetic and devoted that one almost hates to take even a reel of cotton away from such pleasant surroundings." </p>

<p>"I think you might have taken Louise away. I don't like the idea of her being there among a lot of strangers. Supposing some unprincipled person was to get into conversation with her." </p>

<p>"Impossible. Louise has no conversation. I've never discovered a single topic on which she'd anything to say beyond 'Do you think so? I dare say you're right.' I really thought her reticence about the fall of the Ribot Ministry was ridiculous, considering how much her dear mother used to visit Paris. This bread and butter is cut far too thin; it crumbles away long before you can get it to your mouth. One feels so absurd, snapping at one's food in mid-air, like a trout leaping at may-fly." </p>

<p>"I am rather surprised," said the dowager, "that you can sit there making a hearty tea when you've just lost a favourite niece." </p>

<p>"You talk as if I'd lost her in a churchyard sense, instead of having temporarily mislaid her. I'm sure to remember presently where I left her."</p>

<p>"You didn't visit any place of devotion, did you? If you've left her mooning about Westminster Abbey or St. Peter's, Eaton Square, without being able to give any satisfactory reason why she's there, she'll be seized under the Cat and Mouse Act and sent to Reginald McKenna." </p>

<p>"That would be extremely awkward," said Jane, meeting an irresolute piece of bread and butter halfway; "we hardly know the McKennas, and it would be very tiresome having to telephone to some unsympathetic private secretary, describing Louise to him and asking to have her sent back in time for dinner. Fortunately, I didn't go to any place of devotion, though I did get mixed up with a Salvation Army procession. It was quite interesting to be at close quarters with them, they're so absolutely different to what they used to be when I first remember them in the 'eighties. They used to go about then unkempt and dishevelled, in a sort of smiling rage with the world, and now they're spruce and jaunty and flamboyantly decorative, like a geranium bed with religious convictions. Laura Kettleway was going on about them in the lift of the Dover Street Tube the other day, saying what a lot of good work they did, and what a loss it would have been if they'd never existed. ‘If they had never existed,' I said, 'Granville Barker would have been certain to have invented something that looked exactly like them.' If you say things like that, quite loud, in a Tube lift, they always sound like epigrams." </p>

<p>"I think you ought to do something about Louise," said the dowager. </p>

<p>"I'm trying to think whether she was with me when I called on Ada Spelvexit. I rather enjoyed myself there. Ada was trying, as usual, to ram that odious Koriatoffski woman down my throat, knowing perfectly well that I detest her, and in an unguarded moment she said: 'She's leaving her present house and going to Lower Seymour Street.' 'I dare say she will, if she stays there long enough,’ I said. Ada didn't see it for about three minutes, and then she was positively uncivil. No, I am certain I didn't leave Louise there." </p>

<p>"If you could manage to remember where you did leave her, it would be more to the point than these negative assurances," said Lady Beanford; "so far, all that we know is that she is not at the Carrywoods', or Ada Spelvexit's, or Westminster Abbey." </p>

<p>"That narrows the search down a bit," said Jane hopefully; "I rather fancy she must have been with me when I went to Mornay's. I know I went to Mornay's, because I remember meeting that delightful Malcolm What's-his-name there -you know whom I mean. That's the great advantage of people having unusual first names, you needn't try and remember what their other name is. Of course I know one or two other Malcolms, but none that could possibly be described as delightful. He gave me two tickets for the Happy Sunday Evenings in Sloane Square. I've probably left them at Mornay's, but still it was awfully kind of him to give them to me." </p>

<p>"Do you think you left Louise there?" </p>

<p>"I might telephone and ask. Oh, Robert, before you clear the tea-things away I wish you'd ring up Mornay's, in Regent Street, and ask if I left two theatre tickets and one niece in their shop this afternoon." </p>

<p>“A niece, ma'am?" asked the footman. </p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Louise didn't come home with me, and I'm not sure where I left her." </p>

<h4>Louise</h4>

<p>the <span class="highlight"><strong>T</strong></span> will be quite cold. <span class="highlight"><strong>You're</strong></span> better ring for some more, said the <span class="highlight"><strong>damage</strong></span> lady been fed. Susan lady been fed was a vigorous old woman who had <span class="highlight"><strong>co created</strong></span> with imaginary ill health for the greater part of a lifetime. clovers sang Rael irreverently declared that she had caught a chill at the coronation of Queen Victoria and had never let it go again. Her sister James Rob Austin's who was Some years <span class="highlight"><strong>have</strong></span> Jr. was chiefly remarkable for being the most absent minded woman in Middlesex. <strong>(<em>5 errors</em>)</strong></p>

<p>I've really</p>

<p>been unusually clever this afternoon, she remarked gaily as she rang for the tea. I've called on all the people I meant to call on, and I've done all the shopping that I set out to do. I even <span class="highlight"><strong>remember</strong></span> to try and match that silk for you <span class="highlight"><strong>and</strong></span> Harrods. But I'd forgotten to bring the pattern with me. So it was no use. I really think that was the only important thing I forgot during the whole afternoon. quite wonderful for me, isn't it? What have you done with Louise? asked her sister. Didn't you take her out with you? You said you were going to Good gracious. <span class="highlight"><strong>Explain</strong></span>, Jane. What have I done with Louise? I must have left her somewhere. But where? That's <span class="highlight"><strong>justed</strong></span> . (<strong><em>4 errors</em></strong>)</p>

<p>Where have I left her</p>

<p>(I) Can't remember if the carry Woods were at home or if I just left cards. If they were at home, I may have left Louise there to play bridge. I'll go and <span class="highlight"><strong>tell him</strong></span> to Lord Carrie wouldn't find out. Is that you Lord Carrie would? She queried over the telephone? It's me, James rubble stones. I <span class="highlight"><strong>wanted</strong></span> to know. Have you seen Louise? Louise <span class="highlight"><strong>kindly</strong></span> answer. It's been my fate to see it three times. At first, I must admit, I wasn't impressed by it. But the music grows on one after a bit. Still, I don't think I want to see it again. Just at present. Were you going to offer me a seat in your box? Not the opera Louise. My <span class="highlight"><strong>nice</strong></span> Louise throttle stunts. I thought I might have left her at your house. Your left cards on us this afternoon. I understand. But I don't think you left a <span class="highlight"><strong>nice</strong></span> the footman would have been <span class="highlight"><strong>showing</strong></span> have mentioned it if you had, is it going to be a fashion to leave <span class="highlight"><strong>sneezes</strong></span> on people as well as cards? I hope not. Some of these houses in Barclays square have practically no accommodation for that sort of thing. . (<strong><em>7 errors</em></strong>)</p>

<p>She's not</p>

<p>at the Kerry woods, announced to Jane returning to her tea. Now I come to think of it. Perhaps I left her at the silk counter at Selfridges. I may have told her to wait there a moment while I went to look at the silks in a better light. And I may easily have forgotten about her when I found I hadn't your pattern with me. In that case, she's still sitting there. She wouldn't move unless she was told to. Louise has no initiative.</p>

<p>You said you tried to match the <span class="highlight"><strong>silicate</strong></span></p>

<p><span class="highlight"><strong>herons</strong></span> interjected the <span class="highlight"><strong>damage I</strong></span> did I perhaps it was Harrods. . (<strong><em>3 errors</em></strong>)</p>

<p>I really don't remember.</p>

<p>It was one of those places where everyone is so kind and sympathetic and devoted That one almost hates to take even a reel of cotton away from such pleasant surroundings. I think you might have taken Louise away. I don't like the idea of her being there among a lot of strangers. Supposing some unprincipled person was to get into conversation with her. Impossible. Louise has no conversation. I've never discovered a single topic on which <span class="highlight"><strong>she had</strong></span> anything to say beyond. Do you think so? I daresay You're right. I really thought her reticence about the fall of the rebo ministry was ridiculous. Considering how much her dear mother used to visit Paris. This bread and butter is cut far too thin. it crumbles away long before you can get it to your mouth. One feels so <span class="highlight"><strong>observed</strong></span> snapping at One's Food in midair like a trout leaping at <span class="highlight"><strong>me fly</strong></span>. I am rather surprised, said the Dowager that you can sit there making <span class="highlight"><strong>up RTT</strong></span> when you've just lost a favourite niece, you talk as if I had lost her in a church <span class="highlight"><strong>child</strong></span> sense, instead of having temporarily <span class="highlight"><strong>mislead</strong></span> her. I'm sure to remember presently where I left her. You didn't visit any place of devotion, did you? If you've left her mooning about Westminster Abbey <span class="highlight"><strong>awesome</strong></span> Peters Eaton square, without being able to give any satisfactory reason why <span class="highlight"><strong>she is</strong></span> there. She'll be seized under the cat and mouse act and sent to Reginald McKenna. That would be extremely awkward, said Jane, meeting an <span class="highlight"><strong>original</strong></span> <span class="highlight"><strong>huge</strong></span> piece of bread and butter halfway. We hardly know <span class="highlight"><strong>them</strong></span> McKenna's and it would be very tiresome having to telephone to some unsympathetic private secretary, describing Louise to him and asking to have her <span class="highlight"><strong>send</strong></span> back in time for dinner. Fortunately, I didn't go to any place of devotion, though I did get mixed up with <span class="highlight"><strong>the</strong></span> Salvation Army procession It was quite interesting to be at close quarters with them. They're so absolutely different to what they used to be when I first remember them in the 80s. They used to go about then unkempt and dishevelled, in a sort of smiling rage with the world. And now there's spruce and jaunty and flamboyantly decorative, like a geranium bed with religious convictions. Laura kettle away was going on about them in the lift of the Dover Street <span class="highlight"><strong>to</strong></span> the other day, saying what a lot of good work they did, . (<strong><em>14 errors</em></strong>)</p>

<p>and what a loss it would have been if they'd never</p>

<p>existed. If they had never existed, I said, Granville Barker would have been certain to have invented something that looked exactly like</p>

<p>them.</p>

<p>If you say things like that quite loud in a tube lift, they always sound like epigrams I think you ought to do something about Louise, said the Dowager I'm trying to think whether she was with me when I called on either spelled EXID. I rather enjoyed myself there. Ada was trying as usual to ram that odious kotowski woman down my throat, knowing perfectly well that I detest her. And in an unguarded moment, she said she's leaving her present house and going to lower CMOS Street. I dare say she will if she stays there long enough. I said. Ada didn't see it for about three minutes. And then she was positively uncivil? No, I am certain I didn't leave Louise there. If you could manage to remember where you did leave her. It would be more to the point than these negative assurances, said lady be inferred. so far. All that we know is that she is not at the Kerry woods or ADA spell of exits, or Westminster Abbey that narrows the search <span class="highlight"><strong>done In a bit</strong></span> <span class="highlight"><strong>sad</strong></span> Jane hopefully, I rather fancy She must have been with me when I went to Monet's. I know I went to more names because I remember meeting that delightful Malcolm, what's his name there? You know <span class="highlight"><strong>who</strong></span> <span class="highlight"><strong>may</strong></span> mean? That's the great advantage of people having unusual first names, you'll <span class="highlight"><strong>need to try</strong></span> and remember what their other name is. Of course, I know one or two other Malcolm's but none that could possibly be described as delightful. He gave me two tickets for the <span class="highlight"><strong>happier</strong></span> Sunday evenings in Sloane Square. I probably left <span class="highlight"><strong>the mud</strong></span> Monet's, but still it was awfully kind of him to give them to me. Do you think you left Louise there? I might telephone and ask. Oh, Robert, before you clear the <span class="highlight"><strong>two</strong></span> things away. I wish <span class="highlight"><strong>she</strong></span> would ring up Monet's in Regent Street and ask if I left two theatre tickets and one <span class="highlight"><strong>nice</strong></span> in their shop this afternoon. A <span class="highlight"><strong>nice</strong></span> <span class="highlight"><strong>smell</strong></span>. <span class="highlight"><strong>Ask</strong></span> the footman. Yes, Miss Louise didn't come home with me. And I'm not sure where I left her. Miss Louise has been upstairs all the afternoon, ma'am. Reading to the second kitchen maid who has the neuralgia. I took up <span class="highlight"><strong>to you</strong></span> to miss Louise at a quarter to five o'clock, ma'am. Of course, How silly of me. I remember now, I asked her to read the fairy queen to pour Emma to try to send her to sleep. I always get someone to read the fairy queen to me when I have neuralgia and it usually sends me to sleep. Louise doesn't seem to have been successful, but one can't say she hasn't tried. I expect after the first hour or so the kitchen maid would rather have been left alone with her neuralgia. But of course, Louise wouldn't leave off till someone told her to. Anyhow, you can ring up Monet's Robert and ask whether I left <span class="highlight"><strong>to</strong></span> theatre Tickets there. Except for your silk Susan.

<h4>'LOUISE' (correct and complete text)</h4>

<p>“The tea will be quite cold, you'd better ring for some more," said the Dowager Lady Beanford. </p>

<p>Susan Lady Beanford was a vigorous old woman who had coquetted with imaginary ill-health for the greater part of a lifetime; Clovis Sangrail irreverently declared that she had caught a chill at the Coronation of Queen Victoria and had never let it go again. Her sister, Jane Thropplestance, who was some years her junior, was chiefly remarkable for being the most absent-minded woman in Middlesex. </p>

<p>"I've really been unusually clever this afternoon," she remarked gaily, as she rang for the tea. "I've called on all the people I meant to call on, and I've done all the shopping that I set out to do. I even remembered to try and match that silk for you at Harrod's, but I'd forgotten to bring the pattern with me, so it was no use. I really think that was the only important thing I forgot during the whole afternoon. Quite wonderful for me, isn't it?" </p>

<p>"What have you done with Louise?" asked her sister. "Didn't you take her out with you? You said you were going to." </p>

<p>"Good gracious," exclaimed Jane, "what have I done with Louise? I must have left her somewhere." </p>

<p>"But where?" </p>

<p>"That's just it. Where have I left her? I can't remember if the Carrywoods were at home or if I just left cards. If they were at home I may have left Louise there to play bridge. I'll go and telephone to Lord Carrywood and find out." </p>

<p>"Is that you, Lord Carrywood?" she queried over the telephone; "it's me, Jane Thropplestance. I want to know, have you seen Louise?" </p>

<p>"'Louise,'" came the answer, "it's been my fate to see it three times. At first, I must admit, I wasn't impressed by it, but the music grows on one after a bit. Still, I don't think I want to see it again just at present. Were you going to offer me a seat in your box?" </p>

<p>"Not the opera 'Louise' -my niece, Louise Thropplestance. I thought I might have left her at your house." </p>

<p>“You left cards on us this afternoon, I understand, but I don't think you left a niece. The footman would have been sure to have mentioned it if you had. Is it going to be a fashion to leave nieces on people as well as cards? I hope not; some of these houses in Berkeley-square have practically no accommodation for that sort of thing." </p>

<p>"She's not at the Carrywoods'," announced Jane, returning to her tea; "now I come to think of it, perhaps I left her at the silk counter at Selfridge's. I may have told her to wait there a moment while I went to look at the silks in a better light, and I may easily have forgotten about her when I found I hadn't your pattern with me. In that case she's still sitting there. She wouldn't move unless she was told to; Louise has no initiative." </p>

<p>"You said you tried to match the silk at Harrod's," interjected the dowager. </p>

<p>"Did I? Perhaps it was Harrod's. I really don't remember. It was one of those places where every one is so kind and sympathetic and devoted that one almost hates to take even a reel of cotton away from such pleasant surroundings." </p>

<p>"I think you might have taken Louise away. I don't like the idea of her being there among a lot of strangers. Supposing some unprincipled person was to get into conversation with her." </p>

<p>"Impossible. Louise has no conversation. I've never discovered a single topic on which she'd anything to say beyond 'Do you think so? I dare say you're right.' I really thought her reticence about the fall of the Ribot Ministry was ridiculous, considering how much her dear mother used to visit Paris. This bread and butter is cut far too thin; it crumbles away long before you can get it to your mouth. One feels so absurd, snapping at one's food in mid-air, like a trout leaping at may-fly." </p>

<p>"I am rather surprised," said the dowager, "that you can sit there making a hearty tea when you've just lost a favourite niece." </p>

<p>"You talk as if I'd lost her in a churchyard sense, instead of having temporarily mislaid her. I'm sure to remember presently where I left her."</p>

<p>"You didn't visit any place of devotion, did you? If you've left her mooning about Westminster Abbey or St. Peter's, Eaton Square, without being able to give any satisfactory reason why she's there, she'll be seized under the Cat and Mouse Act and sent to Reginald McKenna." </p>

<p>"That would be extremely awkward," said Jane, meeting an irresolute piece of bread and butter halfway; "we hardly know the McKennas, and it would be very tiresome having to telephone to some unsympathetic private secretary, describing Louise to him and asking to have her sent back in time for dinner. Fortunately, I didn't go to any place of devotion, though I did get mixed up with a Salvation Army procession. It was quite interesting to be at close quarters with them, they're so absolutely different to what they used to be when I first remember them in the 'eighties.

If you say things like that, quite loud, in a Tube lift, they always sound like epigrams." </p>

<p>"I think you ought to do something about Louise," said the dowager. </p>

<p>"I'm trying to think whether she was with me when I called on Ada Spelvexit. I rather enjoyed myself there. Ada was trying, as usual, to ram that odious Koriatoffski woman down my throat, knowing perfectly well that I detest her, and in an unguarded moment she said: 'She's leaving her present house and going to Lower Seymour Street.' 'I dare say she will, if she stays there long enough,’ I said. Ada didn't see it for about three minutes, and then she was positively uncivil. No, I am certain I didn't leave Louise there." </p>

<p>"If you could manage to remember where you did leave her, it would be more to the point than these negative assurances," said Lady Beanford; "so far, all that we know is that she is not at the Carrywoods', or Ada Spelvexit's, or Westminster Abbey." </p>

<p>"That narrows the search down a bit," said Jane hopefully; "I rather fancy she must have been with me when I went to Mornay's. I know I went to Mornay's, because I remember meeting that delightful Malcolm What's-his-name there -you know whom I mean. That's the great advantage of people having unusual first names, you needn't try and remember what their other name is. Of course I know one or two other Malcolms, but none that could possibly be described as delightful. He gave me two tickets for the Happy Sunday Evenings in Sloane Square. I've probably left them at Mornay's, but still it was awfully kind of him to give them to me." </p>

<p>"Do you think you left Louise there?" </p>

<p>"I might telephone and ask. Oh, Robert, before you clear the tea-things away I wish you'd ring up Mornay's, in Regent Street, and ask if I left two theatre tickets and one niece in their shop this afternoon." </p>

<p>“A niece, ma'am?" asked the footman. </p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Louise didn't come home with me, and I'm not sure where I left her." </p>

<p>"Miss Louise has been upstairs all the afternoon, ma'am, reading to the second kitchenmaid, who has the neuralgia. I took up tea to Miss Louise at a quarter to five o'clock, ma'am." </p>

            <h3>Automatic Transcription of Video via YouTube Studio</h3>
       
        <p>Video can be uploaded to YouTube in order to generate Closed Captions. YouTube ‘Studio’ (available to all user accounts) allows the upload of multiple (but unique) files (up to 15 at once) by browse, or drag-and-drop selection into browser upload area. Upload is a two stage process, - a standard-definition (SD) file will first be generated, and after a processing period, depending on original file quality, a higher resolution version will become available.</p>
        
        <p>Three main window tabs form the process of file upload and configuration for publication. As part of the initial processing upon upload you can select: 
          <ul>
              <li>Language, subtitles and closed captions (CC)</li>
              <li>License and distribution</li>
              <li>Visibility - options for online publication. This can be set to ‘Private’ to restrict viewing to permitted users only</li>
          </ul>
           <p>There are a few different English options available from the Language, subtitles and closed captions (CC) form, these based on regional vocalisation and dialect. </p>

           <p> Once refreshed (i.e. the upload status changed from ‘Refresh’ to ‘Published, Automatic’) you then have the option to edit, download or delete video files. There is also an option within the page to ‘Add language’ by which you can add an additional set of transcription captions in a different language.</p>
           
          <h5>Transcription Edit Options</h5>
        <p>The edit options in YouTube Studio allow: </p>
        <ul>
           <li>editing of the transcript text (see left-hand column in image below) and </li>
            <li>editing of timecode position and the duration of each text block by dragging to new position, cropping and stretching of text-boxes placed along a timeline (this located beneath the video preview)</li>
            <li>introduction of new subtitle text, or removal of existing</li>

   <h4>Testing of YouTube Transcription</h4>
  <p>Transcription via YouTube Studio was tested by the upload of a short duration UK Supreme Court (UKSC) video file, as sourced from TNA Discovery. The audio was first manually transcribed in order to produce a complete and correct text with which to compare with transcription text output. Consistency checks were made by submitting the same content on subsequent occasions. The text output turned out to be consistent in all cases, including areas of missing text. It should be noted that punctuation is not a feature available from this service.

<p>All rise!</p>

<p>Judgement to the appeal Queen on the application of the E against the governing body of JFS and Queen on the application of E against the governing body of JFS and the united synagogue.</p>

<p>The JFS formerly the Jews free school has an admissions policy that gives preference to children who are recognized as Jewish according to the Orthodox Jewish religion. This means that the child's mother must either be descended from a Jewish mother herself or have converted to Judaism in accordance with the requirements of Jewish orthodoxy. This appeal is about a boy whose mother converted to Judaism in a way that did not satisfy the Orthodox requirements. He was refused entry to the school. His father challenged the admissions policy on the ground that in discriminating against those who had not been recognised as Jewish it breached the race relations act. That act forbids discrimination on the ground of ethnic origin. The majority of the court has concluded that the JFS admission policy does discriminate on the ground of ethnic origin and is in consequence unlawful. The minority disagrees considering that the admission requirement is exclusively a religious requirement that does not depend on ethnic origin. The majority have made it plain in their judgments that the fact that the JFS admission policy has fallen foul of the race relations act certainly does not mean that those responsible for the admission policy have behaved in a way that is racist as that word is generally understood. In the result the substantive appeal is dismissed. The appeal on costs of the United synagogue is allowed to the extent set out in the judgment of Lord Hope.</p>

<h3>Google Docs (in-Browser) transcription</h3>
<p>Google Docs supports speech recognition by which the text of a document can be populated in near real time by dictation via a hardware built-in or external microphone.</p>



 <div class="box-div1">
      
       <img src="images/Microphone_Privacy.jpg" alt="PC Microphone_Privacy setting for online speech recognition" width=55% class="float-left"> 
            
                 <p>Google Docs can also be used to automatically transcribe from ‘computer sound’ (a setting by which sound from a browser or media player etc. can be captured) as well as via microphone. To enable its use in this manner (in Windows 10) the ‘Online speech recognition’ switch (found in <strong><em>Settings > Privacy > Speech</em></strong>) must be set to <span class="code-blue">On</span>.</p>     
             
             </div>
             
<div class="box-div1">
<img src="images/sound_settings.jpg" alt="PC sound settings" width="40%" class="float-left" >
       
<p>Additionally the Input option under <strong><em>settings > Sound</em></strong> needs to be changed from the built-in microphone to the ‘<span class="code-blue">Stereo Mix</span>’ option, - this enables recording of PC sound. </p>
<p>It would appear from testing that capture is to some extent dependent on the PC volume level being above a certain threshold (possibly to limit interference from low level background speech). The Master Volume level for the Output Device (Speakers) should be set to as high as 100% to ensure that all voices are recognised for capture. </p>
<p>In order to avoid annoyance to others from playback, and to maintain privacy, the PC’s output speakers can be effectively muted <em>without</em> reducing the PC volume simply by plugging a headphone extension cable (without headphones attached) into the PC’s headphone/ audio out socket.</p>

          <p>In order to transcribe speech from a desired source simply open a GoogleDocs document in a Chrome browser, and from the Tools menu select ‘<span class="code-blue">Voice typing</span>’ (Ctrl+Shift+S). You will then see a small pop-up window with a microphone icon.</p>

      <h3>Consistency Checks</h3> 
<p>Three transcription runs were made against the same video (UKSC video: cr1-09-12-16-judgements_imx30_1.mp4 from TNA Discovery). The video was played from one Chrome browser instance, while GoogleDocs was used to record from a second Chrome instance. </p>
<p>As a visual estimate of consistency of capture, the text of each run was compared with another in the online <a target=”_blank” href="https://www.diffchecker.com/diff">DiffChecker</a> tool. It can quickly be seen that there are particular points of inconsistency in capture, - one is after the initial <span class="quote">“All rise!”</span> from a male usher, when a 2nd, another when a female voice pronounces the initial case presentation (it should be noted that there is an extended pause in speech between the usher and the 2nd speaker). This particular section of speech is not very well recorded and when making a manual transcription I could not be certain as to all the words spoken. The initial few works spoken by a 3rd, male voice (which follows closely after the 2nd female voice) are missed in all tests. This 3rd voice is very clear and well recorded.</p>

<p><em>Judgement to the appeal Queen on the application of the E against the governing body of JFS </em></p>

<p><em>and Queen on the application of E against the governing body of JFS and the united synagogue.</em></p>

<p><em>The JFS formerly the Jews free school has an admissions policy that gives preference to children who are recognized as Jewish according to the Orthodox Jewish religion. This means that the child's mother must either be descended from a Jewish mother herself or have converted to Judaism in accordance with the requirements of Jewish orthodoxy. This appeal is about a boy whose mother converted to Judaism in a way that did not satisfy the Orthodox requirements. He was refused entry to the school. His father challenged the admissions policy on the ground that in discriminating against those who had not been recognised as Jewish it breached the race relations act. That act forbids discrimination on the ground of ethnic origin. The majority of the court has concluded that the JFS admission policy does discriminate on the ground of ethnic origin and is in consequence unlawful. The minority disagrees considering that the admission requirement is exclusively a religious requirement that does not depend on ethnic origin. The majority have made it plain in their judgments that the fact that the JFS admission policy has fallen foul of the race relations act certainly does not mean that those responsible for the admission policy have behaved in a way that is racist as that word is generally understood. In the result the substantive appeal is dismissed. The appeal on costs of the United synagogue is allowed to the extent set out in the judgment of Lord Hope.</em></p>

    Amazon Transcribe uses advanced machine learning technologies to recognize speech in audio files and transcribe them into text. You can use Amazon Transcribe to convert audio to text and to create applications that incorporate the content of audio files. For example, you can transcribe the audio track from a video recording to create closed captioning for the video.</p>
<p><a target=”_blank” href="https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/home?region=eu-west-2#welcome">https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/home?region=eu-west-2#welcome</a>
    <span class="quote">“Amazon Transcribe uses a deep learning process called automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text quickly and accurately. Amazon Transcribe can be used to transcribe customer service calls, to automate closed captioning and subtitling, and to generate metadata for media assets to create a fully searchable archive.”</span></p>
<p>Amazon Transcribe automatically adds punctuation and formatting so that the output closely matches the quality of manual transcription”
    You can process audio in batch or in near real-time. Using a secure connection, you can send a live audio stream to the service, and receive a stream of text in response.</p>
<p>Amazon Transcribe returns a timestamp for each word, so that you can easily find a word or phrase in the original recording or add subtitles to video.</p>
<p>You can add new words to the base vocabulary to generate more accurate transcriptions for domain-specific words and phrases... You can specify a list of words to remove from transcripts.
    Speaker changes are automatically recognized and attributed in the text to capture scenarios like telephone calls, meetings, and television shows accurately.</p>
<p>When instructed, Amazon Transcribe can identify and redact sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) from the supported language transcripts. </p>

        </ul>
        <p><strong><em>Alternative results:</em></strong></p>
<p>If enabled this returns multiple transcripts from the same audio.</p> 
<p class="quote">“When Alternative results <em>are not</em> enabled, Amazon Transcribe creates a single transcript with the <em>highest relative confidence by default</em>.

<p>All rise!</p>

<p>Judgement to the appeal Queen on the application of the E against the governing body of JFS and Queen on the application of E against the governing body of JFS and the united synagogue.</p>

<p>The JFS formerly the Jews free school has an admissions policy that gives preference to children who are recognized as Jewish according to the Orthodox Jewish religion. This means that the child's mother must either be descended from a Jewish mother herself or have converted to Judaism in accordance with the requirements of Jewish orthodoxy. This appeal is about a boy whose mother converted to Judaism in a way that did not satisfy the Orthodox requirements. He was refused entry to the school. His father challenged the admissions policy on the ground that in discriminating against those who had not been recognised as Jewish it breached the race relations act. That act forbids discrimination on the ground of ethnic origin. The majority of the court has concluded that the JFS admission policy does discriminate on the ground of ethnic origin and is in consequence unlawful. The minority disagrees considering that the admission requirement is exclusively a religious requirement that does not depend on ethnic origin. The majority have made it plain in their judgments that the fact that the JFS admission policy has fallen foul of the race relations act certainly does not mean that those responsible for the admission policy have behaved in a way that is racist as that word is generally understood. In the result the substantive appeal is dismissed. The appeal on costs of the United synagogue is allowed to the extent set out in the judgment of Lord Hope.</p>

<p><em>Judgement in the appeal Office of Fair Trading against Abbey National PLC and others.</em></p>

<p><em>This appeal was not about whether bank charges for those who overdraw on their current accounts are fair. It was about a much narrower issue. On what basis can the OFT, that is the Office of Fair Trading, investigate the fairness of those charges. The relevant regulation says that the OFT is not allowed to assess the fairness of a charge by the test of whether or not it represents a fair price or remuneration for the goods or services provided in exchange.</em></p>

<p><em>The Court of Appeal had held that this exclusion only applied to core terms and that overdraft charges did not constitute core terms. The Supreme Court did not agree with this approach. We have held that overdraft charges form part of the price or remuneration for the package of services that the banks provide to their current account customers. This means that the OFT cannot consider whether in imposing those charges the banks are giving fair value for money. It may still be open to the OFT to assess the fairness of the charges by other criteria.</em></p>

<p><em>For these reasons the Appeal is allowed, the order will be in the terms agreed by council.</em></p>
