            <h1>Testing Automated Transcription Services</h1>
            
           
        
        <h2>Automated Transcription Services</h2>
        
                <p class="explain">Page content best viewed at a browser width of 980px or higher</p>
                 
           
         <p>Automated Transcription Services are online systems that offer the capability to process either a live stream of audio, such as from a microphone, or from recorded audio within a digital file, and then output text from speech by using speech-recognition in combination with other technologies, possibly including aspects of 'Machine Learning' and Artificial Intelligence'.</p>    
         
         <h4>Features</h4>
                  
         <p>Some common featured offered by automated services are</p>
         
         <ul>
             <li>Automatic speech recognition - may be enabled by Deep Neural Network</li>
             <li>multiple vocabularies - data sets to enable recognition and processing of differnt languages, and potentially dialects</li>
             <li>Automatic punctuation - the automatic addition of punctuation to text output</li>
             <li>Speaker recognition</li>
             <li>Multi-channel recognition</li>
             <li></li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>In order to achieve optimal results from these services the audio source will contain clear voices without strong accents, and with little or no background noise. Where the audio source is unclear, there are high levels of noise, or speakers have strong accents then a manual transcription service would be the correct alternative.</p>
        
        <h3>Testing Plan</h3>
        
        <p>Some limited testing was performed in order to evaluate the performance of certain text to speech services in terms of accuracy of output, and service or plan feature set.</p>
        
        <p>At the time of review, of those services considered within this research period, trial options tended to be quite limited: in the extent of testing tine time allowed and features included, or in the option to upload files - and where possible, then generally a set limit in the number and duration files to be processed.</p>
        <p>For those services that either did not allow video upload but did allow audio file formats As essentially we are just testing the handling of sound - use audio only content to limit file size of test files. </p>
        <h4>
            Use public domain sources of speech.</h4>
        <p>Librivox audio-book readings is one good option for isolated, single as they are recorded largely by amateur readers with domestic equipment, rather than to professional standards in studio conditions, which would not generally be representative of video collections.  </p>

          Librivox recording (public domain) of short story Louise by Saki. </p>
            <ul>
        <li> 1 reader. </li>
          <li>Audio recording quality: Fair</li>
          <li>Bitrate: 128Kbps, 64 Kbps</li> 
          <li>Vocalisation clear (‘home-counties’, ‘old BBC’) English accent.</li>
         <li> Rate of speech moderate to slow</li>
         </ul>
            
            <p><strong> Test file 2: </strong><br>
          As Test file 1 above, except at a bitrate of 64Kbps</p>
          
          
        
        
        <h4>Estimating Percentage of Error: </h4>
        <ol>
           <li>Get number of errors: 
         <ul>
               <li>Count number of errors from output text (with any timecode or other ‘non-written-text’ elements removed) compared with the manually transcribed version (with quotation marks removed). Make note of any paragraph variations that might skew comparison results</li>
          </ul>
           <li> Divide number of errors by total of words</li>
            <li>Multiply by 100 to give the error percentage</li>
            
            <li>Does punctuation in the source throw off comparison checks? </li> </ol>

        <p>Video must be uploaded to YouTube for generation of ‘Closed Captions’ to take
            As of 2016 video, states that automatic transcriptions can take from a minute to a day.</p>
            <p>No punctuation, you can edit the transcriptions on YouTube after generation. No text output, tough apparently there is a get around.</p>

        <h4>Google Voice</h4>
        
        <p>These services require upload or sending through of link to video to be processed, OR upload audio only - mp3 etc.</p>
        
        <p>Online Services
            Temi - around 10c per minute
            Spext - around 25c per minute</p>
        <p>Automated processes, fast turnaround, - require very clear audio. Results may be variable, particularly where background noise/ music present or speaker has a strong accent. Not recommended by video host where high level of accuracy is important (though 2nd, manual clean up run could be made to fix errors)</p>

<p>LOUISE </p>

<p>“The tea will be quite cold, you'd better ring for some more," said the Dowager Lady Beanford. </p>

<p>Susan Lady Beanford was a vigorous old woman who had coquetted with imaginary ill-health for the greater part of a lifetime; Clovis Sangrail irreverently declared that she had caught a chill at the Coronation of Queen Victoria and had never let it go again. Her sister, Jane Thropplestance, who was some years her junior, was chiefly remarkable for being the most absent-minded woman in Middlesex. </p>

<p>"I've really been unusually clever this afternoon," she remarked gaily, as she rang for the tea. "I've called on all the people I meant to call on, and I've done all the shopping that I set out to do. I even remembered to try and match that silk for you at Harrod's, but I'd forgotten to bring the pattern with me, so it was no use. I really think that was the only important thing I forgot during the whole afternoon. Quite wonderful for me, isn't it?" </p>

<p>"What have you done with Louise?" asked her sister. "Didn't you take her out with you? You said you were going to." </p>

<p>"Good gracious," exclaimed Jane, "what have I done with Louise? I must have left her somewhere." </p>

<p>"But where?" </p>

<p>"That's just it. Where have I left her? I can't remember if the Carrywoods were at home or if I just left cards. If they were at home I may have left Louise there to play bridge. I'll go and telephone to Lord Carrywood and find out." </p>

<p>"Is that you, Lord Carrywood?" she queried over the telephone; "it's me, Jane Thropplestance. I want to know, have you seen Louise?" </p>

<p>"'Louise,'" came the answer, "it's been my fate to see it three times. At first, I must admit, I wasn't impressed by it, but the music grows on one after a bit. Still, I don't think I want to see it again just at present. Were you going to offer me a seat in your box?" </p>

<p>"Not the opera 'Louise' -my niece, Louise Thropplestance. I thought I might have left her at your house." </p>

<p>“You left cards on us this afternoon, I understand, but I don't think you left a niece. The footman would have been sure to have mentioned it if you had. Is it going to be a fashion to leave nieces on people as well as cards? I hope not; some of these houses in Berkeley-square have practically no accommodation for that sort of thing." </p>

<p>"She's not at the Carrywoods'," announced Jane, returning to her tea; "now I come to think of it, perhaps I left her at the silk counter at Selfridge's. I may have told her to wait there a moment while I went to look at the silks in a better light, and I may easily have forgotten about her when I found I hadn't your pattern with me. In that case she's still sitting there. She wouldn't move unless she was told to; Louise has no initiative." </p>

<p>"You said you tried to match the silk at Harrod's," interjected the dowager. </p>

<p>"Did I? Perhaps it was Harrod's. I really don't remember. It was one of those places where every one is so kind and sympathetic and devoted that one almost hates to take even a reel of cotton away from such pleasant surroundings." </p>

<p>"I think you might have taken Louise away. I don't like the idea of her being there among a lot of strangers. Supposing some unprincipled person was to get into conversation with her." </p>

<p>"Impossible. Louise has no conversation. I've never discovered a single topic on which she'd anything to say beyond 'Do you think so? I dare say you're right.' I really thought her reticence about the fall of the Ribot Ministry was ridiculous, considering how much her dear mother used to visit Paris. This bread and butter is cut far too thin; it crumbles away long before you can get it to your mouth. One feels so absurd, snapping at one's food in mid-air, like a trout leaping at may-fly." </p>

<p>"I am rather surprised," said the dowager, "that you can sit there making a hearty tea when you've just lost a favourite niece." </p>

<p>"You talk as if I'd lost her in a churchyard sense, instead of having temporarily mislaid her. I'm sure to remember presently where I left her."</p>

<p>"You didn't visit any place of devotion, did you? If you've left her mooning about Westminster Abbey or St. Peter's, Eaton Square, without being able to give any satisfactory reason why she's there, she'll be seized under the Cat and Mouse Act and sent to Reginald McKenna." </p>

<p>"That would be extremely awkward," said Jane, meeting an irresolute piece of bread and butter halfway; "we hardly know the McKennas, and it would be very tiresome having to telephone to some unsympathetic private secretary, describing Louise to him and asking to have her sent back in time for dinner. Fortunately, I didn't go to any place of devotion, though I did get mixed up with a Salvation Army procession. It was quite interesting to be at close quarters with them, they're so absolutely different to what they used to be when I first remember them in the 'eighties. They used to go about then unkempt and dishevelled, in a sort of smiling rage with the world, and now they're spruce and jaunty and flamboyantly decorative, like a geranium bed with religious convictions. Laura Kettleway was going on about them in the lift of the Dover Street Tube the other day, saying what a lot of good work they did, and what a loss it would have been if they'd never existed. ‘If they had never existed,' I said, 'Granville Barker would have been certain to have invented something that looked exactly like them.' If you say things like that, quite loud, in a Tube lift, they always sound like epigrams." </p>

<p>"I think you ought to do something about Louise," said the dowager. </p>

<p>"I'm trying to think whether she was with me when I called on Ada Spelvexit. I rather enjoyed myself there. Ada was trying, as usual, to ram that odious Koriatoffski woman down my throat, knowing perfectly well that I detest her, and in an unguarded moment she said: 'She's leaving her present house and going to Lower Seymour Street.' 'I dare say she will, if she stays there long enough,’ I said. Ada didn't see it for about three minutes, and then she was positively uncivil. No, I am certain I didn't leave Louise there." </p>

<p>"If you could manage to remember where you did leave her, it would be more to the point than these negative assurances," said Lady Beanford; "so far, all that we know is that she is not at the Carrywoods', or Ada Spelvexit's, or Westminster Abbey." </p>

<p>"That narrows the search down a bit," said Jane hopefully; "I rather fancy she must have been with me when I went to Mornay's. I know I went to Mornay's, because I remember meeting that delightful Malcolm What's-his-name there -you know whom I mean. That's the great advantage of people having unusual first names, you needn't try and remember what their other name is. Of course I know one or two other Malcolms, but none that could possibly be described as delightful. He gave me two tickets for the Happy Sunday Evenings in Sloane Square. I've probably left them at Mornay's, but still it was awfully kind of him to give them to me." </p>

<p>"Do you think you left Louise there?" </p>

<p>"I might telephone and ask. Oh, Robert, before you clear the tea-things away I wish you'd ring up Mornay's, in Regent Street, and ask if I left two theatre tickets and one niece in their shop this afternoon." </p>

<p>“A niece, ma'am?" asked the footman. </p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Louise didn't come home with me, and I'm not sure where I left her." </p>

<p>"Miss Louise has been upstairs all the afternoon, ma'am, reading to the second kitchenmaid, who has the neuralgia. I took up tea to Miss Louise at a quarter to five o'clock, ma'am." </p>

<p>"Of course, how silly of me. I remember now, I asked her to read the Faerie Queene to poor Emma, to try to send her to sleep. I always get some one to read the Faerie Queene to me when I have neuralgia, and it usually sends me to sleep. Louise doesn't seem to have been successful, but one can't say she hasn't tried. I expect after the first hour or so the kitchenmaid would rather have been left alone with her neuralgia, but of course Louise wouldn't leave off till some one told her to. Anyhow, you can ring up Mornay's, Robert, and ask whether I left two theatre tickets there. Except for your silk, Susan, those seem to be the only things I've forgotten this afternoon. Quite wonderful for me.” </p>

<p>Louise</p>

<p>the T will be quite cold. You're better ring for some more, said the damage lady been fed. Susan lady been fed was a vigorous old woman who had co created with imaginary ill health for the greater part of a lifetime. clovers sang Rael irreverently declared that she had caught a chill at the coronation of Queen Victoria and had never let it go again. Her sister James Rob Austin's who was Some years have Jr. was chiefly remarkable for being the most absent minded woman in Middlesex. (5)</p>

<p>I've really</p>

<p>been unusually clever this afternoon, she remarked gaily as she rang for the tea. I've called on all the people I meant to call on, and I've done all the shopping that I set out to do. I even remember to try and match that silk for you and Harrods. But I'd forgotten to bring the pattern with me. So it was no use. I really think that was the only important thing I forgot during the whole afternoon. quite wonderful for me, isn't it? What have you done with Louise? asked her sister. Didn't you take her out with you? You said you were going to Good gracious. Explain, Jane. What have I done with Louise? I must have left her somewhere. But where? That's justed . (4)</p>

<p>Where have I left her</p>

<p>(I) Can't remember if the carry Woods were at home or if I just left cards. If they were at home, I may have left Louise there to play bridge. I'll go and tell him to Lord Carrie wouldn't find out. Is that you Lord Carrie would? She queried over the telephone? It's me, James rubble stones. I wanted to know. Have you seen Louise? Louise kindly answer. It's been my fate to see it three times. At first, I must admit, I wasn't impressed by it. But the music grows on one after a bit. Still, I don't think I want to see it again. Just at present. Were you going to offer me a seat in your box? Not the opera Louise. My nice Louise throttle stunts. I thought I might have left her at your house. Your left cards on us this afternoon. I understand. But I don't think you left a nice the footman would have been showing have mentioned it if you had, is it going to be a fashion to leave sneezes on people as well as cards? I hope not. Some of these houses in Barclays square have practically no accommodation for that sort of thing. . (10)</p>

<p>She's not</p>

<p>at the Kerry woods, announced to Jane returning to her tea. Now I come to think of it. Perhaps I left her at the silk counter at Selfridges. I may have told her to wait there a moment while I went to look at the silks in a better light. And I may easily have forgotten about her when I found I hadn't your pattern with me. In that case, she's still sitting there. She wouldn't move unless she was told to. Louise has no initiative.</p>

<p>You said you tried to match the silicate</p>

<p>herons interjected the damage I did I perhaps it was Harrods. . (3)</p>

<p>I really don't remember.</p>

<p>It was one of those places where everyone is so kind and sympathetic and devoted That one almost hates to take even a reel of cotton away from such pleasant surroundings. I think you might have taken Louise away. I don't like the idea of her being there among a lot of strangers. Supposing some unprincipled person was to get into conversation with her. Impossible. Louise has no conversation. I've never discovered a single topic on which she had anything to say beyond. Do you think so? I daresay You're right. I really thought her reticence about the fall of the rebo ministry was ridiculous. Considering how much her dear mother used to visit Paris. This bread and butter is cut far too thin. it crumbles away long before you can get it to your mouth. One feels so observed snapping at One's Food in midair like a trout leaping at me fly. I am rather surprised, said the Dowager that you can sit there making up RTT when you've just lost a favourite niece, you talk as if I had lost her in a church child sense, instead of having temporarily mislead her. I'm sure to remember presently where I left her. You didn't visit any place of devotion, did you? If you've left her mooning about Westminster Abbey awesome Peters Eaton square, without being able to give any satisfactory reason why she is there. She'll be seized under the cat and mouse act and sent to Reginald McKenna. That would be extremely awkward, said Jane, meeting an original huge piece of bread and butter halfway. We hardly know them McKenna's and it would be very tiresome having to telephone to some unsympathetic private secretary, describing Louise to him and asking to have her send back in time for dinner. Fortunately, I didn't go to any place of devotion, though I did get mixed up with the Salvation Army procession It was quite interesting to be at close quarters with them. They're so absolutely different to what they used to be when I first remember them in the 80s. They used to go about then unkempt and dishevelled, in a sort of smiling rage with the world. And now there's spruce and jaunty and flamboyantly decorative, like a geranium bed with religious convictions. Laura kettle away was going on about them in the lift of the Dover Street to the other day, saying what a lot of good work they did, . (14)</p>

<p>and what a loss it would have been if they'd never</p>

<p>existed. If they had never existed, I said, Granville Barker would have been certain to have invented something that looked exactly like</p>

<p>them.</p>

<p>If you say things like that quite loud in a tube lift, they always sound like epigrams I think you ought to do something about Louise, said the Dowager I'm trying to think whether she was with me when I called on either spelled EXID. I rather enjoyed myself there. Ada was trying as usual to ram that odious kotowski woman down my throat, knowing perfectly well that I detest her. And in an unguarded moment, she said she's leaving her present house and going to lower CMOS Street. I dare say she will if she stays there long enough. I said. Ada didn't see it for about three minutes. And then she was positively uncivil? No, I am certain I didn't leave Louise there. If you could manage to remember where you did leave her. It would be more to the point than these negative assurances, said lady be inferred. so far. All that we know is that she is not at the Kerry woods or ADA spell of exits, or Westminster Abbey that narrows the search done In a bit sad Jane hopefully, I rather fancy She must have been with me when I went to Monet's. I know I went to more names because I remember meeting that delightful Malcolm, what's his name there? You know who may mean? That's the great advantage of people having unusual first names, you'll need to try and remember what their other name is. Of course, I know one or two other Malcolm's but none that could possibly be described as delightful. He gave me two tickets for the happier Sunday evenings in Sloane Square. I probably left the mud Monet's, but still it was awfully kind of him to give them to me. Do you think you left Louise there? I might telephone and ask. Oh, Robert, before you clear the two things away. I wish she would ring up Monet's in Regent Street and ask if I left two theatre tickets and one nice in their shop this afternoon. A nice smell. Ask the footman. Yes, Miss Louise didn't come home with me. And I'm not sure where I left her. Miss Louise has been upstairs all the afternoon, ma'am. Reading to the second kitchen maid who has the neuralgia. I took up to you to miss Louise at a quarter to five o'clock, ma'am. Of course, How silly of me. I remember now, I asked her to read the fairy queen to pour Emma to try to send her to sleep. I always get someone to read the fairy queen to me when I have neuralgia and it usually sends me to sleep. Louise doesn't seem to have been successful, but one can't say she hasn't tried. I expect after the first hour or so the kitchen maid would rather have been left alone with her neuralgia. But of course, Louise wouldn't leave off till someone told her to. Anyhow, you can ring up Monet's Robert and ask whether I left to theatre Tickets there. Except for your silk Susan. Those seem to be the only things I've forgotten this afternoon, Connie, wonderful for me and of Louise Recording by Graham Redmond. . (17)</p>

<p>Judgement to the appeal Queen on the application of the E against the governing body of JFS and Queen on the application of E against the governing body of JFS and the united synagogue.</p>

<p>The JFS formerly the Jews free school has an admissions policy that gives preference to children who are recognized as Jewish according to the Orthodox Jewish religion. This means that the child's mother must either be descended from a Jewish mother herself or have converted to Judaism in accordance with the requirements of Jewish orthodoxy. This appeal is about a boy whose mother converted to Judaism in a way that did not satisfy the Orthodox requirements. He was refused entry to the school. His father challenged the admissions policy on the ground that in discriminating against those who had not been recognised as Jewish it breached the race relations act. That act forbids discrimination on the ground of ethnic origin. The majority of the court has concluded that the JFS admission policy does discriminate on the ground of ethnic origin and is in consequence unlawful. The minority disagrees considering that the admission requirement is exclusively a religious requirement that does not depend on ethnic origin. The majority have made it plain in their judgments that the fact that the JFS admission policy has fallen foul of the race relations act certainly does not mean that those responsible for the admission policy have behaved in a way that is racist as that word is generally understood. In the result the substantive appeal is dismissed. The appeal on costs of the United synagogue is allowed to the extent set out in the judgment of Lord Hope.</p>

<p>In order to avoid annoyance to others from playback, and to maintain privacy, the PC’s output speakers should be effectively muted <em>without</em> reducing the PC volume. One simple way to achieve this is to plug a headphone extension cable (without headphones attached) into the PC’s headphone socket. </p>

      <p>The pop-up should then be replaced with a red, active recording microphone icon, which when actually capturing sound gains animated rings.</p>

<p><em>Judgement to the appeal Queen on the application of the E against the governing body of JFS </em></p>

<p><em>and Queen on the application of E against the governing body of JFS and the united synagogue.</em></p>

<p><em>The JFS formerly the Jews free school has an admissions policy that gives preference to children who are recognized as Jewish according to the Orthodox Jewish religion. This means that the child's mother must either be descended from a Jewish mother herself or have converted to Judaism in accordance with the requirements of Jewish orthodoxy. This appeal is about a boy whose mother converted to Judaism in a way that did not satisfy the Orthodox requirements. He was refused entry to the school. His father challenged the admissions policy on the ground that in discriminating against those who had not been recognised as Jewish it breached the race relations act. That act forbids discrimination on the ground of ethnic origin. The majority of the court has concluded that the JFS admission policy does discriminate on the ground of ethnic origin and is in consequence unlawful. The minority disagrees considering that the admission requirement is exclusively a religious requirement that does not depend on ethnic origin. The majority have made it plain in their judgments that the fact that the JFS admission policy has fallen foul of the race relations act certainly does not mean that those responsible for the admission policy have behaved in a way that is racist as that word is generally understood. In the result the substantive appeal is dismissed. The appeal on costs of the United synagogue is allowed to the extent set out in the judgment of Lord Hope.</em></p>

   <h3>Consistency Checks</h3> 
<p>Three transcription runs were made against the same video (UKSC video: cr1-09-12-16-judgements_imx30_1.mp4 (from <a target=”_blank” href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/VideoPlayer/?url=https://tna-video-player.s3.amazonaws.com/66/UKSC/1/cr1-09-12-16-judgements_imx30_1.mp4">http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/VideoPlayer/?url=https://tna-video-player.s3.amazonaws.com/66/UKSC/1/cr1-09-12-16-judgements_imx30_1.mp4</a>). The video was played from one Chrome browser instance, while GoogleDocs was used from a second. </p>
<p>As a visual estimate of consistency of capture, the text of each run was compared with another in the online tool ‘DiffChecker’ (<a target=”_blank” href="https://www.diffchecker.com/diff">https://www.diffchecker.com/diff</a>). It can quickly be seen that there are particular points of inconsistency in capture, one is after the initial “All rise!” from a male usher, when a 2nd, female voice pronounces the initial case presentation (it should be noted that there is an extended pause in speech between the usher and the 2nd speaker). This section of speech is not very well recorded and when making a manual transcription I could not be certain as to all the words spoken. The initial few works spoken by a 3rd, male voice, which follows closely after the 2nd, are missed in all tests, - speculatively this may be due to a delay in the speech recognition engine becoming active from an ‘uncertainty’ in how to proceed. This 3rd voice is very clear and well recorded.</p>

    Amazon Transcribe uses advanced machine learning technologies to recognize speech in audio files and transcribe them into text. You can use Amazon Transcribe to convert audio to text and to create applications that incorporate the content of audio files. For example, you can transcribe the audio track from a video recording to create closed captioning for the video.</p>
<p><a target=”_blank” href="https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/home?region=eu-west-2#welcome">https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/home?region=eu-west-2#welcome</a>
    <span class="quote">“Amazon Transcribe uses a deep learning process called automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text quickly and accurately. Amazon Transcribe can be used to transcribe customer service calls, to automate closed captioning and subtitling, and to generate metadata for media assets to create a fully searchable archive.”</span></p>
<p>Amazon Transcribe automatically adds punctuation and formatting so that the output closely matches the quality of manual transcription”
    You can process audio in batch or in near real-time. Using a secure connection, you can send a live audio stream to the service, and receive a stream of text in response.</p>
<p>Amazon Transcribe returns a timestamp for each word, so that you can easily find a word or phrase in the original recording or add subtitles to video.</p>
<p>You can add new words to the base vocabulary to generate more accurate transcriptions for domain-specific words and phrases... You can specify a list of words to remove from transcripts.
    Speaker changes are automatically recognized and attributed in the text to capture scenarios like telephone calls, meetings, and television shows accurately.</p>
<p>When instructed, Amazon Transcribe can identify and redact sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) from the supported language transcripts. </p>

    <span class="quote">“Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) service…Using the Amazon Transcribe API, you can analyze audio files stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and have the service return a text file of the transcribed speech… </span></p>
<p class="quote">In this tutorial you will download a sample audio file then upload it to a S3 bucket that you will create. Then you will use Amazon Transcribe to create a transcript from the sample audio clip using the AWS Management Console…</p>
<p class="quote">This tutorial is a demo of the functionality that is available when using the AWS CLI or the Transcribe API. For production or proof of concept implementations, we recommend using these programmatic interfaces rather than the Amazon Transcribe Console.”</p>

<h4>Workflow</h4>
 
 <ul>
      
     <li>Set up S3 Bucket, name: <span class="code-blue">transcription-test-ih</span></li>
     <li>Custom Vocabulary as described on the tutorial page is not apparent from my test-job under ‘Specify Job Details’</li>
     <li>Some of the elements described are slightly different in the job itself, e.g. the Output data location options on the job page are: Service-managed S3 bucket or Customer specified S3 bucket. In the tutorial ‘Amazon default’ or ‘Customer specified.’</li>
     <li><span class="code-blue">Audio_identification</span> options not on this page, on next: <span class="quote">“If you enable Channel identification, Amazon Transcribe is able to process audio where each speaker is recorded on different channels and produce a single transcript annotated with channel labels..”</span> – could be very useful for LOCOG which definitely holds multi-channel audio</li>
   <li>If you enable <span class="code-blue">Speaker identification</span>, Amazon Transcribe recognizes when the speaker changes and attributes the transcribed text appropriately. – feature not on this page: </li></ul>
   
  <p> All configuration options are now on the one page: </p>
   <p><strong><em>Audio identification</em></strong> – If enabled you can select either:</p> 
<ul>
   <li><span class="code-blue">Channel identification</span> - for split of multi-channel audio in to separate channels for transcription</li>
    <li><span class="code-blue">Speaker identification</span> – identify multiple speakers (you must enter a multiple: 2 or more) in a <span class="quote">“mono-channel audio recording”</span> – see how this copes with standard stereo channel arrangement.
        Here you can provided a maximum number of speakers, to try and increase accuracy </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em>Alternative results:</em></strong></p>
<p>If enabled this returns multiple transcripts from the same audio.</p> 
<p class="quote">“When Alternative results <em>are not</em> enabled, Amazon Transcribe creates a single transcript with the <em>highest relative confidence by default</em>. You can request up to 10 alternative transcriptions. Each transcription returned must reach a minimum confidence threshold set by Amazon Transcribe. While Amazon Transcribe may not have as much confidence in the alternative transcriptions, the results could be better suited for your needs.”</p>
 
 <p><span class="code-blue">Automatic content redaction</span> can be used to try to automatically remove “personally identifiable information (PII)”, though these are apparently generic assumptions – credit card, possibly mobile number etc. </p>
<p><span class="code-blue">Vocabulary filtering</span> – to remove specified words</p>

<p><span class="code-blue">Custom Vocabulary</span> – to add specific words that might be niche and hard to transcribe, medical terms, legal etc.</p>

<p>All rise!</p>

<p>Judgement to the appeal Queen on the application of the E against the governing body of JFS and Queen on the application of E against the governing body of JFS and the united synagogue.</p>

<p>The JFS formerly the Jews free school has an admissions policy that gives preference to children who are recognized as Jewish according to the Orthodox Jewish religion. This means that the child's mother must either be descended from a Jewish mother herself or have converted to Judaism in accordance with the requirements of Jewish orthodoxy. This appeal is about a boy whose mother converted to Judaism in a way that did not satisfy the Orthodox requirements. He was refused entry to the school. His father challenged the admissions policy on the ground that in discriminating against those who had not been recognised as Jewish it breached the race relations act. That act forbids discrimination on the ground of ethnic origin. The majority of the court has concluded that the JFS admission policy does discriminate on the ground of ethnic origin and is in consequence unlawful. The minority disagrees considering that the admission requirement is exclusively a religious requirement that does not depend on ethnic origin. The majority have made it plain in their judgments that the fact that the JFS admission policy has fallen foul of the race relations act certainly does not mean that those responsible for the admission policy have behaved in a way that is racist as that word is generally understood. In the result the substantive appeal is dismissed. The appeal on costs of the United synagogue is allowed to the extent set out in the judgment of Lord Hope.</p>

<p><em>Judgement in the appeal Office of Fair Trading against Abbey National PLC and others.</em></p>

<p><em>This appeal was not about whether bank charges for those who overdraw on their current accounts are fair. It was about a much narrower issue. On what basis can the OFT, that is the Office of Fair Trading, investigate the fairness of those charges. The relevant regulation says that the OFT is not allowed to assess the fairness of a charge by the test of whether or not it represents a fair price or remuneration for the goods or services provided in exchange.</em></p>

<p><em>The Court of Appeal had held that this exclusion only applied to core terms and that overdraft charges did not constitute core terms. The Supreme Court did not agree with this approach. We have held that overdraft charges form part of the price or remuneration for the package of services that the banks provide to their current account customers. This means that the OFT cannot consider whether in imposing those charges the banks are giving fair value for money. It may still be open to the OFT to assess the fairness of the charges by other criteria.</em></p>

<p><em>Judgement in the appeal Office of Fair Trading against Abbey National PLC and others.</em></p>

<p><em>This appeal was not about whether bank charges for those who overdraw on their current accounts are fair. It was about a much narrower issue. On what basis can the OFT, that is the Office of Fair Trading, investigate the fairness of those charges. The relevant regulation says that the OFT is not allowed to assess the fairness of a charge by the test of whether or not it represents a fair price or remuneration for the goods or services provided in exchange.</em></p>

<p><em>The Court of Appeal had held that this exclusion only applied to core terms and that overdraft charges did not constitute core terms. The Supreme Court did not agree with this approach. We have held that overdraft charges form part of the price or remuneration for the package of services that the banks provide to their current account customers. This means that the OFT cannot consider whether in imposing those charges the banks are giving fair value for money. It may still be open to the OFT to assess the fairness of the charges by other criteria.</em></p>

<p><em>For these reasons the Appeal is allowed, the order will be in the terms agreed by council.</em></p>
