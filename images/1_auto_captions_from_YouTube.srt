1
00:00:20,050 --> 00:01:03,860
all right the JFS formerly the Jews free

2
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:05,540
school has an admissions policy that

3
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,510
gives preference to children who are

4
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,990
recognized as Jewish according to the

5
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,909
Orthodox Jewish religion this means that

6
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,770
the child's mother must either be

7
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:19,010
descended from a Jewish mother herself

8
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,690
or have converted to Judaism in

9
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,960
accordance with the requirements of

10
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:26,630
Jewish orthodoxy this appeal is about a

11
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,090
boy whose mother converted to Judaism in

12
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,820
a way that did not satisfy the Orthodox

13
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,369
requirements he was refused entry to the

14
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,740
school his father challenged the

15
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:38,689
admissions policy on the ground that in

16
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,240
discriminating against those who had not

17
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:44,420
recognised as Jewish it breached the

18
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,460
race relations act that act forbids

19
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,100
discrimination on the ground of ethnic

20
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,890
origin the majority of the court has

21
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,320
concluded that the JFS admission policy

22
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,539
does discriminate on the ground of

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,570
ethnic origin and is in consequence

24
00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:01,280
unlawful the minority disagrees

25
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,920
considering that the admission

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,289
requirement is exclusively a religious

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,050
requirement that does not depend on

28
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:11,210
ethnic origin the majority have made it

29
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,819
plain in their judgments that the fact

30
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:16,400
that the JFS admission policy has fallen

31
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,890
foul of the race relations act certainly

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,410
does not mean that those responsible for

33
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,720
the admission policy have behaved in a

34
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,390
way that is racist as that word is

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,940
generally understood in the result the

36
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,650
substantive appeal is dismissed the

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,150
appeal on costs of the United synagogue

38
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,250
is allowed to the

39
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,250
sit out in the judgment of Lord hope

40
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,729
[Applause]
