00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.600
which he strongly believes should be published in the public interest.

A raised the claim that, the respondent's refusal of permission

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.800
to publish, had acted in a way incompatible

chapter-33
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.400

chapter-34
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.500
