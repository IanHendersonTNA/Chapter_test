My Lords, I appear on behalf of uh, the appellant

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:49.800
I'll refer to simply as 'A'

chapter-4
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.800
Along with Mr Vasal Adams

chapter-5
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200
My learned friends: Mr Jonathan Crow...

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.300
Mr Jason Copel

Lords, this is an appeal against a decision of the court of appeal

chapter-12
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600
of the 18th of February of this year,

chapter-13
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.000
that the Administrative Court has no jurisdiction

chapter-14
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.800
to hear proceedings brought by 'A' against the respondent

chapter-15
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.600
pursuant to Section 7-1A of the Human Rights Act.

chapter-16
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.000
Just out of interest, why's it so clear that

chapter-17
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.500
the claim is under 7-1A rather than

chapter-18
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.000
a claim which involves reliance on the convention right: 7-1B?
