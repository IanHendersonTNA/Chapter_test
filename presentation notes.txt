What is Video Chaptering? 
'Chaptering' as used here in an AV context is the division of the playback timeline representing the duration of a digital video file in order to allow easy navigation to pre-determined points of interest identified within an AV recording. The longer the duration of a video or audio file, the more difficult it is for a user to identify and locate points of interest.

Aims of the project
To investigate methods of annotating points of interest within a timeline, and allow a user to navigate directly via timecode to the points that relate.

While generally talking about video - in both cases transcription and chaptering the same processes can be applied to audio only files as well as video)
