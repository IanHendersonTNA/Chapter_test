<v Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, KG> Yes, Mr Moore.

<v Mr Moore, lawyer> My Lords, I appear on behalf of uh, the appellant 

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:49.800
I'll refer to simply as 'A'.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.800
Along with Mr Vasal Adams

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200
My learned friends: Mr Jonathan Crow...

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.300
Mr Jason Copel

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.200
appear for the respondent, 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.300
and my learned friends: Lord Panic and Mr Higgin

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.800
uh, appear on behalf of justice

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.300
as an intervener in this appeal.

000:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Mr Moore, lawyer> Lords, this is an appeal against a decision of the court of appeal

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600
of the 18th of February of this year,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.000
that the Administrative Court has no jurisdiction

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.800
to hear proceedings brought by 'A' against the respondent

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.600
pursuant to Section 7-1A of the Human Rights Act.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.600
A is a former member of the security service

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.600
and R is the director of establishments of security service.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.100
A has brought judicial review proceedings challenging

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.300
R's respondent's refusal to authorise publication of a book

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.300
he's written about his time in the service

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.600
which he strongly believes should be published in the public interest.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.200
Without the authority from the respondents

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.500
A's obligation of confidentiality bites, and he cannot publish.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
Lords, the jurisdiction issue arises because...

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.200
in addition to challenging on traditional public law grounds

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500
of irrationality and bias

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.500
A raised the claim that, the respondent's refusal of permission

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.500
was unlawful in the sense identified in Section 6.1

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.200
of the Human Rights Act 1998

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.800
i.e. that the respondent as a public authority in refusing authority

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.800
to publish, had acted in a way incompatible

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.400
with A's conventional right to freedom of expression

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.500
under Article 10 of the European Convention.
